# Notes

## Workflow
- Create a repo on github with defaults
- Clone the repo locally and work there
  - Working on github doesn't work due to the name of references to the CSS file
- commit changes to your local copy of the repository
- push our changes back up to the "origin"
- github is the "source of truth"
- make a change to your local files, save and go back to the browser and refresh the page to get the update
